```


## Error Handling

The package includes custom exceptions for handling common API errors:

try:
    # Fetch playlists or perform some other API operation
    playlists = api.playlists.get_latest_playlists()
except BeatSaverNotFoundError:
    print("The requested resource was not found.")
except BeatSaverAuthError:
    print("Authentication failed.")
except BeatSaverRateLimitError:
    print("Rate limit exceeded. Please try again later.")
